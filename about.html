            My name is Peter Gibbons. I have many hobbies, and interests, some of which include basketball, 
            golf, gaming, and creative writing. After obtaining my dogwood diploma from Lord Byng Secondary 
            I decided to take a gap year to gain some real-world experience. During this time, I played a lot of golf, 
            wrote some short stories, developed a passion for game development, and worked at HSBC for almost a year
            and a half. Throughout my day to day activities at HSBC I developed a yearning sensation to go back to school
            to hone my skills in computer programming with the goal of becoming a game developer. During my search I 
            came across BCIT and found out that they offer a Game Development program, to which the first step to getting 
            in would be by first completing the CIT or CST program. When I came across the description for both the 
            CIT program as well as the Game Development program, I thought to myself “This is exactly what I 
            am looking for” so I sent in my application and thankfully got accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main reason why I decided to go with the CIT program over the CST program is because I thought it would make myself 
            a more well rounded programmer. Even though I enjoy making and designing programs alot more then the technical aspect I have 
            been really enjoying the program so far. I have learnt so many new topics, theories, and rules that i find quite
            fascinating.
